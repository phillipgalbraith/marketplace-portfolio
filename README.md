Africa Locally Owned Sales 
gives small business owners tools to market their products effectively by comparing prices and sharing locations, and is also a resource for local shoppers.
"Where local products thrive with competitive prices."

## MVP  Features

## Front-End Developers: To begin building a component

make sure you are on the main branch for the first pull. it's okay if this doesn't "do anything".
 - $ git branch// make sure you're working on main 

 - $ git pull origin main // make sure your local main branch is up to date

 - $ git checkout -b <the name of the component you are working on & your first name>
  --- example: - $ git checkout -b login-form-phil

// now you are working on your own branch

## When you want to submit your changes
 - $ git add .
 - $ git commit -m "< describe last change made >
 
Navigate to main
 - $ git checkout main             
 
Pull the latest main 
- $ git pull origin main

Navigate to branch to make sure it's got the most up to date changes from main
 - $ git checkout < your branch name>
 - $ git merge main

Make sure your component still works
Push to your branch
 - $ git push origin < your branch name>
